    <h1>A beginner's guide to hiking:<br>everything you need for your first hike!</h1>
    <p>There's nothing more embarrassing than a city slicker getting lost in the woods, so let's make sure you know
        where you're going, what to wear and what to bring.<br>
        That way your first hike will be fun, adventurous and more importantly safe! </p>
    <h3>A hike also be super simple and fun</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>A quike jaunt(such a great word, right) around your local park after work.</li>
        <li>Exploring the woods behind your house with your kids on a saturday morning.</li>
        <li>A half_day hike with your friends on a fun nature trail.</li>
        <li>A full day or overnight hike that also includes camping.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>
        Here’s my definition for hiking: A person (or halfing, or self-aware robot) exploring their surroundings and
        their feet are on the actual ground. Like, dirt. And grass.
    </h3>
    <p>Some might say it needs to be difficult, have a certain elevation change, require a blah blah blah. It literally
        doesn’t matter.<br>

        What matters is that you go outside and do something you wouldn’t have done otherwise.<br>

        Here in the Nerd Fitness Rebellion, hikers would fall into the Adventurer class.<br>

        If you’re looking for a fun “cardio” activity and want to exercise in a way that’s exciting, hiking is a great
        way to get your legs, feet, and body used to strenuous activity.<br>

        You get to pick your speed and difficulty, you can always find a way the right amount of challenge for you.</p>
    <h3><u>HIKING 101: 5 STEPS TO PLAN OUT YOUR ADVENTURE</u></h3>
    <p><b>1) Decide how long you have to hike.</b> This is a beginner’s guide to hiking, we’re not looking to hike the
        Appalachian Trail. Instead, we want to start with trails that can be done in less than a day, that won’t require
        you to pack a tent, or bring extra change of clothes. Pick a hike based on how much time you have – do you have
        the entire Sunday? Or do you just have a few hours on a Tuesday afternoon? It took Frodo and Sam 6 months to get
        to Mordor, but you probably don’t have that much time.
        <br>
        However, if you DID want to “walk to Mordor,” I got you covered there too. You’re welcome!
        <br><br>
        <b>2) Decide if you’ll be hiking solo or with a friend/group </b>– I love hiking solo – it’s mobile meditation
        for me. However, it’s also more dangerous should anything happen while you’re out on the trail! If you’re
        heading into the wilderness, I’d recommend buddying up with a friend or your significant other for your hike.
        It’s the perfect bonding opportunity. This is especially true if they have more hiking experience or they know
        the area that you’re hiking in.
        <br><br>
        <b>3) Determine your level </b>– if you are a hiking newbie and horribly out of shape, sending yourself out on
        an eight hour hike through the unmapped wilderness is incredibly unintelligent. And as your mom has probably
        told you before, “I thought you were smarter than that.”
        <br>
        Start slow, and pick places around your town that will allow you to stop when necessary and get back to your car
        or home quickly. No need to be a hero; it’s always better to come back excited and say “wow that was easier than
        I expected!” than to realize you’re six hours from home and out of steam. Well, being a hero is cool. But not
        THAT kind of hero.
        <br><br>
        <b>4) Pick your hiking location </b>– Keep it simple! Go to AllTrails.com, put in your zip code, find your
        hiking trail!

        Or pull up Google Maps and look for big green plots of land. We call those “parks.” Google the park name, learn
        about it, and decide if that’s where you want to go. Do not over complicate this step. Just get started.

        Ask your active, adventurous friends or coworkers if they know any good spots.

        The world is FULL of hiking trails and awesomeness – you just need to know where to look.
        <br><br>
        <b>5) Regardless of where you are going, let somebody else know where are when </b>– if you are out hiking
        alone, take the time to email or call somebody and let him know that you’ll be hiking and when you expect to be
        back.

        We don’t want to hear about any 127 Hours stories on NF…that would make playing video games way more
        difficult.

        You don’t need to tell them the brand of your underwear (please tell me you’re wearing underwear) or how many
        almonds you’re bringing, but let them know the important details so if they don’t hear back from you by a
        certain time they know to alert the proper authorities.</p>
    <h3><u>WHAT SHOES SHOULD I WEAR TO HIKE IN?</u></h3>
    <p><b>LEVEL ONE: Hiking shoes </b>– “hiking shoes” are great if you’re going to be doing simple day hikes or hiking
        occasionally: they have good grip on the bottom, give you enough support, but aren’t too heavy that they are a
        hindrance.
    </p>
    <b>Here are my favorite options if you in the market for some new basic walking/hiking shoes:</b>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Merrell Vent Hiking Shoe</li>
        <li>
            Merrell Trail Glove 4 (Men) – I have the blue ones. They rock.</li>
        <li>
            Merrell Trail Glove 4 (women)Oh what’s that? “Steve I don’t have hiking shoes! Is this the end of the
            world?” Well, do you have any sort of athletic shoe? Depending on the grip on the bottom, they could be
            decently okay for you to get started with when it comes to a basic hike.If sneakers are your only option,
            lace em up, pick a beginner hike, and see how they do. Just be careful on slippery surfaces – your kicks
            might not give you the grip won’t give you the grip you need to get over them.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Oh, what’s that? “Steve, I don’t have hiking shoes! Is this the end of the world?” Well, do you have any sort of

        it comes to a basic hike. If sneakers are your only option, lace em up, pick a beginner hike, and see how they
        do. Just be careful on slippery surfaces – your kicks might not give you the grip won’t give you the grip you
        need to get over them.
    </p>
    <p><b>LEVEL TWO – Hiking boots </b>– I don’t hike enough or do enough multi-day hikes to justify the cost of hiking
        boots, but again I would point to Merrell boots if you’re in the market.
        <br>
        <i>“Why boots over shoes, Steve?” </i><br>
        Although many prefer trail shoes (like yours truly), I can absolutely see the value in a great pair of hiking
        boots if you’re going on a serious hike, traveling for multiple days, or more. They have more ankle support,
        thicker tread, thicker shoes, and provide your feet with significantly more protection.
    </p>
    <h3>WHAT SOCKS SHOULD YOU WEAR?</h3>
    <p>
        If you’re wearing boots or sneakers, you want to wear socks that aren’t going to give you blisters or make your
        feet all sweaty and gross.
        <br><br>
        Depending on how long the hike is, how serious you are about hiking, and your budget, you can look into
        merino-wool socks.
        <br><br>
        Like the rest of your outfit, what you wear on your feet will largely be dependent on a few things:
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Weather! </b>Are you hiking in the a forest and it’s 72 degrees out? Or are you hiking up the side of
                the mountain in cold conditions?
            </li>
            <li><b>Shoes!</b> Are you in lightweight hiking shoes, lightweight hiking socks for the win. Hiking in big
                boots in cold months? Big thick warm socks are almost a requirement.
            </li>
            <li><b>Budget!</b> Are you shopping for specific socks? Tall or short? Great. If you are brand new to
                hiking, just wear whatever athletic socks you wear while exercising.
            </li>
            <li><b>What’s the environment? </b>If you’re hiking through grass, tall plants, etc. I’d go with tall socks
                (with your pants possibly tucked into them too). You’re not out there to win a fashion show!</li>
        </ol>
    </P>
    <h3>SHOULD I WEAR PANTS OR SHORTS?</h3>
    <p>Pro tip: Don’t go pantless through the wilderness. I cannot stress this enough.
        The real advice when it comes to pants/shorts is heavily dependent upon your environment. If it’s going to be
        cold, shorts might keep you shivering. If it’s going to be hot, pants might get too uncomfortable.
        Jeans? Ehhhhh. Sure. ONLY if its going to be a comfortable temperature and you have no other option. Being
        sweaty and hot while wearing jeans isn’t very fun.
        <br>I’m a big fan of my nerd pants – the Columbia Silver Ridge pants. Although they look kind of goofy, they’re
        incredibly light weight, dry quickly, and can transform from pants to shorts in mere seconds!
        <br><b>Traveling through woods, not sure what you’ll encounter? Wear lightweight pants.</b> I am horribly
        allergic to poison ivy and who knows what else, so I like to keep as much of my body covered while hiking to
        make sure I don’t make contact with anything I’m allergic to.
    </p>
    <h3>WHAT TYPE OF SHIRT SHOULD I WEAR? </h3>
    <p>
        My favorite options are merino wool long shirts and t-shirts: they’re light, wick away moisture, hide odors, and
        breathe well – though you will be paying top dollar for them.
        If you’re just starting out, pick an old t-shirt and rock that – you can work on optimizing performance once
        you’ve got a few hikes under your belt.
        Shameless plug: the Nerd Fitness t-shirt does hold up quite well to wear and tear over long periods of time –
        I’ve been rocking my shirt in heavy rotation on lots of hikes for years. It can also withstand gamma rays and
        makes you invisible.
        if you’re on a multi-day hike in various conditions then having lightweight merino wool shirts you can layer and
        not need to wash would be great. But just going for a hike in the woods in your back yard? Whatever you would
        wear while running, training, etc. Aka whatever won’t chafe!</p>
    <h3>SHOULD I BRING A JACKET?</h3>
    <p>
        I’ve been wearing this Mountain Hardware jacket on most of my hikes and it has been awesome (10 years and
        counting) – very lightweight so packing it isn’t a hassle, waterproof so it keeps me dry when it rains, and
        heavy enough to block the wind to keep me warm when it’s chilly.
        Don’t go out of your way to buy a new jacket if you have a decent wind breaker, but if you’re going to be doing
        a lot of hiking or you’re in the market for a new coat, here’s my advice: go to a local store and try out all of
        the jackets until you find one you like.
        Once you find the perfect jacket, go home and check online (you can sometimes find the same jacket for up to 60%
        less) – then, ask the local store if they’ll price match or just buy it online.</p>

    <h3>FAVORITE WATER CONTAINERS:</h3>
    <p>I’m partial to stainless steel bottles or aluminum bottles over Nalgene or reused plastic bottles, but make do
        with what you have. Make sure you bring enough water with you to keep you hydrated through your adventure.
        Going on longer hikes? Get yourself a hydration backpack (which can double as your hiking pack!) to transplant
        water more conveniently.
        <br>Not only that, but make sure you have been consuming water before you go hiking so that you’re not starting
        at a hydration deficit.
        <br>Hangovers + early morning hikes – water = bad news bears.</p>

    <h3>Here’s what I’d recommend you bring with you on your adventure:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Sunscreen</b> – If it’s sunny outside and you’re hiking through the woods or up a mountain with a cool
            breeze in
            your face, you probably won’t be able to tell that your ears and face are getting absolutely torched. Get
            yourself some waterproof sweatproof sunscreen (SPF 30 minimum) to cover up those ears, cheeks, and back of
            your neck.</li>
        <li><b>Bug spray </b>– especially if it’s “that time of the year” in your area where bugs are out in full force.
            Nothing worse than coming home to arms and legs covered in bug bites.</li>
        <li><b>First aid kit </b>– Having some first aid stuff with you is a good idea: band-aids and moleskin for
            blisters and
            cuts, Neosporin or some type of disinfectant for cuts/scrapes, and maybe a bandage or two just in case.
            Outdoor stores sell travel first aid kits (as does Amazon), but I’d advise you to make your own (you should
            have these things in your medicine cabinet anyways – and then you’ll know exactly where everything is!).
        </li>
        <li><b>Pocket knife </b>– Not essential if you’re in a park, but a good thing to have with you out in the woods
            so
            you’re prepared for anything. Like McGyver.</li>
        <li><b>Sunglasses</b> – No need to go blind while out on the trail. You probably already have sunglasses
            floating
            around your house: I’d recommend bringing the $5 ones rather than $250 Ray-Bans.</li>
        <li><b>Cellphone </b>– a phone can help bail you out in case of emergency, and if you have a smart phone it can
            multitask as your compass, distance tracker, mapper, and so on. Even if you have a cellphone, bringing a
            compass or GPS system isn’t a bad idea (unless it’s bright and sunny and you’re good at orienting yourself).
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Although by no means a complete list of snacks, this is usually what I like to pack in my bag before a hike:
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Nuts </b>– Almonds or walnuts. Great for snacking on, loaded w/ healthy fat and protein. Nut butters are
            a good healthy fat option too – my favorite is trader Joe’s raw unsalted almond butter. Ingredient: almonds!
            They are high in calorie content however, so if you are trying to lose weight, don’t do a 10 minute walk and
            eat 4000 calories worth of nuts. We in the business like to call that “counterproductive.”
        </li>
        <li><b>Fruit </b>– I throw two or three apples in my bag; apples and nuts mean I’ve pretty much got all of the
            fat, protein, and carbs I need for my day. Things like bananas, raisins, and other fruit are good options as
            well – pick based on your personal preference and tastes. Fruit (especially dried fruit) can have lots of
            sugar and calories, so don’t kid yourself into eating 5000 calories worth of dried fruit and call it
            healthy!
        </li>
        <li><b>Beef jerky!</b> Make your own or go with some high quality store bought stuff. Lots of protein, easy to
            pack, and keeps well. Mmmmmm.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <b> What about trail mix or granola bars? </b>You’d probably think granola bars and trail mix are synonymous with
    hiking, but I’m actually not a fan of either unless they’re homemade – these products are usually loaded with
    salt/sugar and processed grains and are pretty damn unhealthy.
    <br>
    If you’re gonna go with trail mix, make your own with dried fruit and raw unsalted nuts. If you DON’T have other
    options, tossing a few granola bars in the bag isn’t the end of the world.
    <br>
    <b>More food advice here:</b>

    <u>Primal Trail Food</u>
    <p>
        <b>A book (optional) </b>– I LOVE READING (more than I love lowercase letters), so I always travel with my
        Kindle.
        Although hiking with friends can be fun, I also get a huge thrill out of hiking out to a remote location
        overlooking
        a valley or sitting on the edge of a river with a book so that I can spend a few hours getting lost in a story.
        <br>
        If it’s a multi-day hike and you’re avoiding technology, then bringing a dead tree book is worth the extra
        weight in
        your bag!
        <br>
        <b>A camera (optional) </b>– Although I have a camera that I travel with, most of the pictures I’ve been taking
        recently have been done with my iPhone using apps like Camera+ or ProHDR (which I freaking love). Both apps are
        worth the price.
        <br>
        You don’t need to be a great photographer, just need to capture the moment to look back on fondly as a crotchety
        old
        grandpa. Obviously if you’re a serious photographer, you’ve already planned to pack your DSLR so I won’t get
        into
        that.

    <h3>Seven Hiking Tips for Beginners</h3>

    <ol>
        <b>
            <li> THE LOCAL WILDLIFE!
        </b> Do a quick search of your hike to know what sorts of critters you’ll encounter on the trail. If you are
        hiking in bear country or snake country, these are things it’s very important to know. Whether it’s carrying
        a can of bear mace or knowing what to look for, this can help you prevent serious problems. Also, watch out
        for wild ostriches.
        </li>
        <li><b>CLEAN UP, CHECK FOR TICKS </b>– if you’re in a heavily wooded area and carving through the
            wilderness, check yourself for ticks and make sure you take a shower with hot water and soap immediately
            when you get home in case you came in contact with any poisonous plants or things like that. I can’t
            tell you how many times I woke up with a swollen face as a kid because of my hike through poison ivy the
            day before.
        </li>
        <li><b>AIM FOR THE HIGH GROUND </b>– I love hiking to tall things: the top of a mountain, the high point in
            a town, the roof of a building. It gives you a great halfway point to stop, eat some lunch or dinner,
            and enjoy the view; plus, you already know exactly how far you need to go on your way down. One piece of
            advice on going DOWN a steep mountain or a lot of steps: Shorten your stride, and take care to land on
            the balls of your feet with a bent knee if possible – if you’re landing on your heels for thousands of
            steps, it can wreak havoc on your knees and joints as there’s no shock absorption. I remember how sore
            my knees were the day after hiking down Colca Canyon in Peru with my buddy Cash because I didn’t make an
            effort to soften my steps and take care of my body.
        </li>
        <li><b>URBAN HIKING </b>– “But Steve I live in a city, I can’t go hiking!” Why the hell not? Load up your
            backpack, map out a route on Google maps, maybe even find a tall building – avoid the elevator, climb
            the steps. Or walk until you find a park, sit on a bench and read a book. Sure, it’s not the same as
            hiking the Rockies, but it will still get your heart pumping and feet moving! Like The Goonies teaches
            us, adventure can be found in your own backyard with the right attitude!
        </li>
        <li><b>KEEP TRACK OF IT</b> – If you have an iPhone or Android, download a hiking or running app to keep
            track of how far you go and how much hiking you do. Although I haven’t been tracking my hikes abroad (I
            leave my phone in Airplane mode while traveling), I’ve heard great things about RunKeeper and
            EasyTrails. If you have more apps or suggestions on how to keep track of your hikes, let me know in the
            comments and I’ll add them here. I personally use a cheap Fitbit Flex 2, which tracks my steps and
            elevation. Good enough!
        </li>
        <li><b>GEOCACHING </b>– Great fun can be had while geocaching. Simply go to the website, track your
            location, and then decide on which cache you’re going to track down. Think of it like a real life
            version of Indiana Jones or Uncharted, minus the Nazis and undead warriors. We geocached around Sydney
            for a Nerd Fitness meetup, and it was delightful!
        </li>
        <li><b>GIVE A HOOT, DON’T POLLUTE</b> – Pack it in, pack it out. If you bring anything with you, it better
            be coming back with you. Don’t leave trash in the woods, and pick up any extra trash you see out there.
            The wilderness thanks you for your service, citizen!
